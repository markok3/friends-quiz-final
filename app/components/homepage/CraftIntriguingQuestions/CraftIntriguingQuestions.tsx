        One of the keys to a successful <strong>best friend</strong> test is to
        include thought-provoking and fun questions. Don’t just stick to the
        basics like “What’s my favorite color?” Go deeper and ask questions that
        will really make your friends think. For example, you can ask about a
        specific memory you shared, your pet peeves, or even your dream vacation
        destination.
